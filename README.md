Responsive website that resembles given pictures, and has hover effect for thumbnails (hover effect is assumed to refer to effect when mouse pointer hovers over the picture)

Overlay seems to float over the main site

HTML, CSS, and a little JS were used

Issues:
- Have not used chisel
- Should replace multiple functions in test.js with if-else or an analogue
- Could also have used JS to inject text instead of making 4 separate divs with diff id's
